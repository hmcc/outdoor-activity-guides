        <p><blockquote>Inspiring and enthusiastic, Gareth gave me the confidence to experience multi pitch climbing in Wales. These memorable few days were made up of developing rope skills and technical climbing along with lots encouragement and patience from Gareth to overcome fears and learn new skills. Gareth was extremely reassuring and an amazing guide who clearly has a vast amount of outdoor and climbing skills together with knowledge to pass on to any person wishing to improve skills or learn new ones.</blockquote>- Deborah McDonnell</p>
        <p><blockquote>Gareth has been coaching me in climbing for over 2 years and has helped me to improve my performance in both bouldering and lead climbing. He has helped me train and get ready for many competitions, and my best result is 2nd in the BMC youth competition final.</blockquote> - Jo Swales, Energise Youth Team member</p>
        <p><blockquote>We enjoyed the lead climbing course and learnt lots of skills and techniques. We now have the confidence and skills to go climbing on our own. Thanks!</blockquote> - York University Mountaineering Club</p>
        <p><blockquote>Gareth has a wealth of experience of working with young people of different outlook and abilities. He is able to enthuse and motivate individuals in the outdoors, whether they are confident or petrified. He ensures the challenge suits each individual and develops young people through his fun yet professional style. Gareth has worked with multiple groups delivering bronze, silver and gold Duke of Edinburgh's Award expeditions. He has a wealth of knowledge of local routes and campsites for practice and assessment expeditions, delivering a successful silver cycling expedition as well as walking expeditions in many different areas. I would recommend Gareth as an outdoor instructor as he is very organised, thorough, safe and a great person to work with.</blockquote> - Sarah Nicholson, Duke of Edinburgh's Award Coordinator York</p>
